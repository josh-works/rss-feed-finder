        <p>This tiny project inspired by <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26049153">this HN comment</a> on the thread titled: <em>Turn to RSS Feeds to Regain Control of the World Wide Web (techrights.org)</em>

          <i>A tip for those who love RSS but bemoan the slow death it's suffering: Sometimes it helps to simply send an e-mail to the owner of the website and thell them their RSS feed is broken or missing. I've done that and succeeded three times so far.</i>
        </p>

          <i>Sometimes they break the feed because they changed something but didn't bother to check if it affected their feed. This of course won't be of any effect to the big SV type companies, but it might with your local newspaper, municipality website, favourite blog, etc. Doesn't hurt to try. </i>
